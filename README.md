# hoppielib-go

A lightweight, developer-friendly Go library for working with [Hoppie ACARS](https://www.hoppie.nl/acars/), designed to simplify:

- **CPDLC Requests** – Send and receive Controller–Pilot Data Link Communications.
- **General API Requests** – Interact with Hoppie’s API endpoints without wrestling with HTTP boilerplate.
- **Message Formatting & Parsing** – Encode & decode ACARS messages cleanly.

Whether you’re building flight simulator plugins, dispatch tools, or aviation automation systems, `hoppielib-go` helps you focus on your application logic—not the plumbing.
